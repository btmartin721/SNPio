.. class:: PopGenStatistics

The ``PopGenStatistics`` class is designed to perform a suite of population genetic analyses on SNP datasets. It includes methods for calculating D-statistics, detecting Fst outliers, computing genetic diversity metrics, AMOVAs, and calculating population genetic summary statistics. This class is particularly useful for researchers studying population structure, diversity, and genetic variation within and between populations. 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Calculation of Patterson's, partitioned, and/ or D-foil D-statistics.
- Fst outlier detection using DBSCAN or bootstrapping.
- Estimation of heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, and summary statistics.
- Nei's Distance matrix estimation and visualization between populations with dynamic ordering.
- Hierarchical AMOVA with bootstrapping and parallel bootstrapping computation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PopGenStatistics is a part of the ``snpio`` package, which includes classes such as ``GenotypeEncoder``, ``Plotting``, and modules for calculating D-statistics. It depends on packages such as ``numpy``, ``pandas``, ``scipy``, ``scikit-learn``, ``statsmodels``, ``seaborn``, and ``plotly``.

-----------
Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: python

    # Import necessary classes and initialize GenotypeData with your SNP data
    from snpio import VCFReader
    from snpio.popgenstats import PopGenStatistics

    # Load SNP data and metadata into a GenotypeData object
    genotype_data = VCFReader(
        filename="example_data/vcf_files/phylogen_subset14K_sorted.vcf.gz",
        popmapfile="example_data/popmaps/phylogen_nomx.popmap",
        force_popmap=True,  # Remove samples not in the popmap or alignment.
        verbose=True,
    )

    # Initialize PopGenStatistics with genotype data
    pgs = PopGenStatistics(genotype_data, verbose=True)

Methods Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``calculate_d_statistics``  
  Calculates D-statistics (Pattersonâ€™s, partitioned D, or D-foil) with bootstrap replicates. Saves results as CSV and generates informative plots.

* ``detect_fst_outliers``  
  Identifies Fst outliers between populations using bootstrapping or DBSCAN. Generates plots and returns a DataFrame of outlier SNPs.

* ``summary_statistics``  
  Summarizes key statistics (heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, Fst) across populations, with plotting capabilities.

* ``amova``  
  Performs hierarchical Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) with bootstrapping and parallel computation options.

* ``neis_genetic_distance``  
  Calculates Nei's genetic distance between populations.

    * - Method
      - Description
    * - ``calculate_d_statistics``
      - Calculates D-statistics and saves them as CSV. Also generates plots.
    * - ``detect_fst_outliers``
      - Identifies Fst outliers. Returns a DataFrame of outlier SNPs with plots.
    * - ``summary_statistics``
      - Summarizes the following population statistics:
        - Observed heterozygosity (Ho)
        - Expected heterozygosity (He)
        - Nucleotide diversity (Pi)
        - Weir and Cockerham's Fst
    * - ``amova``
      - Conducts AMOVA with bootstrapping and parallel computation.
    * - ``neis_genetic_distance``
      - Computes Nei's genetic distance between population pairs.

Calculated Statistics
---------------------
- D-statistics (Patterson's, Partitioned, and D-foil)
- Fst outliers and pairwise Fst values
- Observed heterozygosity (Ho)
- Expected heterozygosity (He)
- Nucleotide diversity (Pi)
- Weir and Cockerham's Fst (from summary statistics)
- AMOVA results (variance components and Phi statistics)
- Nei's genetic distance

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Advanced Usage and Recent Developments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Distance Matrix Sorting:**  
  The ``plot_dist_matrix`` method employs dynamic ordering based on the sum of distances, ensuring that the populations with the highest overall divergence are highlighted.

- **Parallelization and Reproducibility:**  
  Many methods, including ``amova``, now support parallel computation via setting ``n_jobs=-1`` (or any positive integer value), and users are encouraged to define a random seed for consistent results.

----------------------
Additional Information
----------------------

.. note::

    - Sufficient bootstrap replicates are recommended for robust statistical estimation.
    - For parallel processing, set ``n_jobs=-1`` to utilize all available CPU cores.
    - The ``PopGenStatistics`` class is designed for SNP datasets and may not be suitable for other types of genetic data.
