Version 1.3.21 (2025-06-16)
---------------------------

Documentation and CI/CD build fixes and updates.

Version 1.3.15 (2025-06-14)
---------------------------

Documentation and CI/CD build updates.

Version 1.3.14 (2025-06-12)
---------------------------

Fix sphinx documentation build issues that were introduced in the last release. The documentation now builds correctly without any errors or warnings.

Version 1.3.13 (2025-06-12)
---------------------------

Updated documentation to reflect the latest changes and features to the API in the last few releases. The documentation now includes detailed explanations of the new `GenePopReader` class, the `PopGenStatistics` class methods, and the overall functionality of the library.

Version 1.3.11 (2025-06-12)
---------------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a critical bug in `VCFReader` class that caused reading and writing VCF files to fail due to a typing issue with HDF5 datasets. This bug was introduced in the previous version and has been resolved.

Version 1.3.9 (2025-06-11)
--------------------------

There have been a lot of changes since the last major release, including bug fixes, enhancements, and new features.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bug where the `PopGenStatistics` class did not have the `verbose` and `debug` attributes.
- Fixed lots of bugs with VCFReader class when reading and writing VCF files.
- Fixed bugs in StructureReader and PhylipReader classes when reading and writing STRUCTURE and PHYLIP files.
- Fixed bug where the `PopGenStatistics` class did not have the `genotype_data` attribute.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- VCFReader is now much faster, with benchmarks showing a 40 percent speedup when reading VCF files.
- Added optional `store_format_data` parameter to the `VCFReader` class to store FORMAT metadata in the HDF5 file. Set this to `True` to store FORMAT metadata in the HDF5 file. This can be useful if the format metadata is needed for downstream analysis, but it does drastically slow down the reading and writing of VCF files.
- Added support for reading and writing GenePop files with the `GenePopReader` class.
- `StructureReader` now supports `has_popids` and `has_marker_names` parameters to indicate whether the STRUCTURE file has population IDs column and marker names header row. This allows for more flexibility when reading STRUCTURE files.
- General improvements to code for performance and maintainability.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added new `GenePopReader` class to read and write GenePop files. This class can read GenePop files and convert them to any of the other supported formats. `write_genepop()` method can be used to write the data to a GenePop file from any of the supported formats (VCF, PHYLIP, STRUCTURE, GENEPOP).
- All file formats are interoperable and can be converted to and from each other. This means that you can read a VCF file, convert it to a PHYLIP file, and then convert it to a STRUCTURE file, and so on.

Version 1.2.1 (2025-01-06)
--------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate genetic distances between populations:
    -  calculate genetic distances between populations using the `neis_genetic_distance()` method. The method calculates Nei's genetic distance between populations and returns a pandas DataFrame with the genetic distances.

- The `PopGenStatistics` class now has the following public (user-facing) methods:
    - `neis_genetic_distance`
    - `calculate_d_statistics`
    - `detect_fst_outliers`
    - `summary_statistics`
    - `amova`

- The AMOVA method now returns a dictionary with the AMOVA results. Its functionality has been greatly extended to follow Excoffier et al. (1992) and Excoffier et al. (1999) methods. The method now calculates the variance components (within populations, within regions among popoulations, and among regions), Phi-statistics, and p-values via bootstrapping for the AMOVA analysis. A `regionmap` dictionary is now required to map populations to regions/groups. The method also has the following new parameters:
    - `n_bootstraps`: The number of bootstraps to perform.
    - `n_jobs`: The number of jobs to run in parallel.
    - `random_seed`: The random seed for reproducibility.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate observed and expected heterozygosity per population and nucleotide diversity per population.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate Weir and Cockerham's Fst between populations.
- Improved aesthetics of the Fst heatmap plot.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to plot D-statistics (Patterson's, Partitioned, and D-foil) and save them as CSV files.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate Nei's genetic distance between populations.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to plot Nei's distance matrix between populations.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to plot Fst outliers.
    - Two ways:
        - DBSCAN clustering method
        - Bootstrapping method
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to plot summary statistics. The method now returns a dictionary with the summary statistics.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate AMOVA results. The method now returns a dictionary with the AMOVA results.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate genetic distances between populations. The method calculates Nei's genetic distance between populations and returns a pandas DataFrame with the genetic distances.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Much of the code has been refactored to improve readability and maintainability. This includes moving the `neis_genetic_distance()` method to the `genetic_distance` module, the `amova()` method to the `amova` module, and the `fst_outliers()` method to the `fst_outliers` module. The `summary_statistics()` method has been moved to the `summary_statistics` module, and the D-statistics methods have been moved to the `d_statistics` module.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following method have been deprecated:

- `wrights_fst()`: Uses `weir_cockerham_fst_between_populations()` instead.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bug where the `PopGenStatistics` class did not have the `verbose` and `debug` attributes.
- Fixed bug where the `PopGenStatistics` class did not have the `genotype_data` attribute.
- Fixed warnings in `snpio.plotting.plotting.Plotting` class with the font family.
- Fixed bug with `VCFReader` class when a non-tabix-indexed and uncompressed VCF file was read. The bug caused an error when reading an uncompressed VCF file.

Version 1.2.0 (2024-11-07)
--------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added new functionality to calculate several population genetic statistics using the `PopGenStatistics` class, including:
    - Wright's Fst 
    - nucleotide diversity
    - expected and observed heterozygosity
    - Fst outliers
    - Patterson's, Partitioned, and D-Foil D-statistic tests
    - AMOVAs (Analysis of Molecular Variance)

- The `PopGenStatistics` class now has the following methods:
    - `calculate_d_statistics()`
    - `detect_fst_outliers()`
    - `observed_heterozygosity()`
    - `expected_heterozygosity()`
    - `nucleotide_diversity()`
    - `wrights_fst()`
    - `summary_statistics()`
    - `amova()`

Bootstrapping is performed for D-statistics and Fst outliers, and the results are saved as CSV files. The results are also returned as pandas DataFrames and dictionaries. The D-statistics are plotted, and the Fst outliers are plotted and saved as a CSV file. The summary statistics are plotted and returned as a dictionary.
