Version 1.2.1 (2025-01-06)
----------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~~

- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate genetic distances between populations:
    -  calculate genetic distances between populations using the `neis_genetic_distance()` method. The method calculates Nei's genetic distance between populations and returns a pandas DataFrame with the genetic distances.

- The `PopGenStatistics` class now has the following public (user-facing) methods:
    - `neis_genetic_distance`
    - `calculate_d_statistics`
    - `detect_fst_outliers`
    - `summary_statistics`
    - `amova`

- The AMOVA method now returns a dictionary with the AMOVA results. Its functionality has been greatly extended to follow Excoffier et al. (1992) and Excoffier et al. (1999) methods. The method now calculates the variance components (within populations, within regions among popoulations, and among regions), Phi-statistics, and p-values via bootstrapping for the AMOVA analysis. A `regionmap` dictionary is now required to map populations to regions/groups. The method also has the following new parameters:
    - `n_bootstraps`: The number of bootstraps to perform.
    - `n_jobs`: The number of jobs to run in parallel.
    - `random_seed`: The random seed for reproducibility.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate observed and expected heterozygosity per population and nucleotide diversity per population.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate Weir and Cockerham's Fst between populations.
- Improved aesthetics of the Fst heatmap plot.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to plot D-statistics (Patterson's, Partitioned, and D-foil) and save them as CSV files.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate Nei's genetic distance between populations.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to plot Nei's distance matrix between populations.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to plot Fst outliers.
    - Two ways:
        - DBSCAN clustering method
        - Bootstrapping method
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to plot summary statistics. The method now returns a dictionary with the summary statistics.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate AMOVA results. The method now returns a dictionary with the AMOVA results.
- Improved the `PopGenStatistics` class to include new functionality to calculate genetic distances between populations. The method calculates Nei's genetic distance between populations and returns a pandas DataFrame with the genetic distances.

Changes
~~~~~~~~

- Much of the code has been refactored to improve readability and maintainability. This includes moving the `neis_genetic_distance()` method to the `genetic_distance` module, the `amova()` method to the `amova` module, and the `fst_outliers()` method to the `fst_outliers` module. The `summary_statistics()` method has been moved to the `summary_statistics` module, and the D-statistics methods have been moved to the `d_statistics` module.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following method have been deprecated:

- `wrights_fst()`: Uses `weir_cockerham_fst_between_populations()` instead.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bug where the `PopGenStatistics` class did not have the `verbose` and `debug` attributes.
- Fixed bug where the `PopGenStatistics` class did not have the `genotype_data` attribute.
- Fixed warnings in `snpio.plotting.plotting.Plotting` class with the font family.
- Fixed bug with `VCFReader` class when a non-tabix-indexed and uncompressed VCF file was read. The bug caused an error when reading an uncompressed VCF file.

Version 1.2.0 (2024-11-07)
----------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~~

- Added new functionality to calculate several population genetic statistics using the `PopGenStatistics` class, including:
    - Wright's Fst 
    - nucleotide diversity
    - expected and observed heterozygosity
    - Fst outliers
    - Patterson's, Partitioned, and D-Foil D-statistic tests
    - AMOVAs (Analysis of Molecular Variance)

- The `PopGenStatistics` class now has the following methods:
    - `calculate_d_statistics()`
    - `detect_fst_outliers()`
    - `observed_heterozygosity()`
    - `expected_heterozygosity()`
    - `nucleotide_diversity()`
    - `wrights_fst()`
    - `summary_statistics()`
    - `amova()`

Bootstrapping is performed for D-statistics and Fst outliers, and the results are saved as CSV files. The results are also returned as pandas DataFrames and dictionaries. The D-statistics are plotted, and the Fst outliers are plotted and saved as a CSV file. The summary statistics are plotted and returned as a dictionary.

Version 1.1.3 (2024-10-25)
----------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~~

- Updated tree parsing functionality and added it to the ``TreeParser`` class in the ``analysis/tree_parser.py`` module to conform to refactor, and added new functionality to parse, modify, draw, and save Newick and NEXUS tree files.
- ``siterates`` and ``qmatrix`` files now dynamically determine if they are in IQ-TREE format or if they are just in a simple tab-delimited or comma-delimited format.
- ``site_rates`` and ``qmat`` are now read in as pandas DataFrames with less complex logic.
- Added unit test for tree parsing.
- Added integration test for tree parsing.
- Added documentation for tree parsing.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~

Changes
~~~~~~~~

- ``q`` property is now called ``qmat`` for clarity and easier searching in files.
- Removed redundant ``siterates_iqtree`` and ``qmatrix_iqtree`` arguments attributes from the ``GenotypeData``, ``VCFReader``, ``PhylipReader``, ``StructureReader``, and ``TreeParser`` classes.
