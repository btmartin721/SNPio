## Version 1.6.5 (2025-09-24)

### Bug Fixes - v1.6.5

- Minor bug fixes in `GenotypeEncoder`.

## Version 1.6.4 (2025-09-20)

### Bug Fixes - v1.6.4

- Fixed bug where the `GenotypeEncoder` would fail when decoding 0/1/2 genotypes. The `decode_012` method in the `GenotypeEncoder` class now correctly handles 0/1/2 encoded genotypes, ensuring that they are accurately converted back to their original string representations. This fix resolves issues that arose when using 0/1/2 encoded data.

## Version 1.6.3 (2025-09-20)

### Bug Fixes - v1.6.3

- Fixed bug with 0/1/2 encodings where it would fail. The `GenotypeEncoder` class now correctly handles 0/1/2 encodings, ensuring that genotypes are accurately converted and processed. This fix resolves issues that arose when using 0/1/2 encoded data, allowing for seamless integration with other components of the SNPio library.

### Enhancements - v1.6.3

- Improved the `GenotypeEncoder` class to better handle various genotype encodings, including 0/1/2 and IUPAC codes. The class now includes more consistency in methods for encoding and decoding genotypes, ensuring compatibility with a wider range of input formats. The order of "A", "C", "G", "T" has been standardized across methods to prevent confusion and errors during genotype processing.

### Enhancements - v1.6.6

- Improved the `GenotypeData` class by adding several new properties to enhance data accessibility and analysis capabilities. These properties provide quick access to key dataset characteristics, such as shape, population information, missing data metrics, and memory usage. This enhancement aims to streamline workflows and improve user experience when working with genotype data.
- Added support for when there is no available population map file.
- Added several new dataclasses to encapsulate related data and functionality, improving code organization and maintainability.

## Version 1.6.2 (2025-09-15)

### Bug Fixes - 1.6.2

- Fixed bug where the `ref` and `alt` properties of the `VCFReader` class did not exist before `NRemover2` filtering was applied. This caused errors when trying to access these properties before filtering. The properties now exist and return the correct values before and after filtering.
- Fixed bugs where the format metadata in the VCF file was not being stored in the HDF5 file when reading and writing VCF files with the `VCFReader` class. The `store_format_data` parameter now works as expected, and the format metadata is stored in the HDF5 file when set to `True`.
- Fixed edge case where the `alt` property could inadvertently set some loci to heterozygous IUPAC ambiguity codes (e.g., `"R"`) or missing data values (`"N"`).
- Fixed various minor bugs and edge cases that caused crashes with the example script.

### Enhancements - 1.6.2

- Improved efficiency of the D-statistics calculations by precomputing the encodings for all individuals in the dataset once, and then reusing these encodings for each D-statistic calculation. This reduces redundant computations and speeds up the overall process, especially when dealing with large datasets or multiple population combinations.
- Cleaned up some of the MultiQC report plots for consistency—particularly the Nei genetic distance heatmap and the Fst heatmap plots.
- General efficiency improvements to every module.
- Clarified the public-facing API of the Fst and Nei distance methods in the `PopGenStatistics` class. The methods now have clear and consistent parameter names, return types, and documentation. This makes it easier for users to understand how to use these methods and what to expect from them.
- Added `tqdm` progress bars to the Fst and Nei distance methods in the `PopGenStatistics` class. This provides users with visual feedback on the progress of the calculations, especially for large datasets where the computations may take a significant amount of time.
- The Fst and Nei distance methods now more clearly define how the permutation versus bootstrap methods work. The permutation method randomly shuffles individuals between populations to create a null distribution of Fst values, while the bootstrap method resamples loci with replacement to estimate the variability of Fst values. This distinction is now clearly documented in the method docstrings and user guides.

### Features - 1.6.2

- Added multiprocessing support to the Weir & Cockerham Fst and Nei genetic distance methods in the `PopGenStatistics` class. This allows for parallel computation of pairwise Fst values between populations, significantly speeding up the process for large datasets with many populations. The number of parallel jobs can be controlled with the `n_jobs` parameter.

- Fully functional and validated D-statistics (Patterson, Partitioned, and DFOIL).
- ``NRemover2`` class has been overhauled for efficiency and speed.
- New visualizations in the MultiQC report.
- Bug fixes (General)
- Documentation updates

### Features - v1.6.0

- Added a new ``AlleleSummaryStats`` class to generate allele frequency summary statistics across populations. This class provides methods to calculate allele frequencies, visualize allele distributions, and export results in various formats.
  - The new class is called when ``PopGenStatistics(...).summary_statistics()`` is called, allowing for automatic generation of allele frequency statistics as part of the population genetics analysis workflow.
  - The ``AlleleSummaryStats`` class includes methods for:
    - Calculating allele frequencies per population
    - Visualizing allele frequency distributions
    - Exporting allele frequency data to CSV and JSON formats
    - Generating MultiQC reports with summary statistics and visualizations
- New visualizations have been added to the MultiQC report generator, including:
  - allele frequency distributions
  - D-tests
  - `NRemover2` threshold searches
- New filtering method: ``filter_allele_depth()``. This method filters loci based on allele depth, allowing removal of low-quality or low-coverage loci.

### Enhancements - v1.6.0

- Validated the D-statistics calculations against simulated datasets with known parameters to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
  - D-statistics calculations now include:
    - Patterson's D
    - Partitioned-D
    - D-FOIL
  - These calculations are integrated into the MultiQC report generator, providing a comprehensive view of introgression.
- Improved performance of the D-statistics calculations by using ``numba`` and its ``njit`` decorator for JIT compilation in parallel, significantly speeding up the computation of large datasets.

### Performance Improvements - v1.6.0

- The D-statistics calculations have been optimized for performance, particularly for large datasets. The use of `numba.njit` has significantly reduced computation time, making it feasible to analyze larger genomic datasets efficiently.
- The `NRemover2` class has been enhanced to handle larger datasets more efficiently, with improved memory management and reduced execution time for filtering operations. This was achieved by vectorizing operations and minimizing unnecessary data copies.

### Bug Fixes - v1.6.0

- Fixed a minor edge case in the `VCFReader` class that resulted in incorrect shapes when filtering with `NRemover2`. The shape of the ``loci_indices`` and ``sample_indices`` attributes is now correctly maintained after filtering operations.

### Documentation Updates - v1.6.0

Use autosummary to generate documentation, and also limit the user-facing documentation to the public methods and attributes of the classes. This ensures that only relevant information is presented to users, making the documentation cleaner and more focused.

## Version 1.5.5 (2025-07-07)

### Bug Fixes - Docker Image

- Docker image now correctly installs the latest version of SNPio from PyPI. Before, it was installing an older version due to a caching issue in the Docker build process. The Dockerfile has been updated to ensure that the latest version is always installed.
- Additional docker image issues fixed.

## Version 1.5.0 (2025-07-04)

This major release introduces a fully interactive MultiQC report generator that integrates results across all SNPio modules. It also includes significant upgrades to the `PopGenStatistics` class, new downstream analysis capabilities, and key bug fixes.

## Version 1.3.9 (2025-06-11)

There have been a lot of changes since the last major release, including bug fixes, enhancements, and new features.

### Bug Fixes (v1.3.9)

- Fixed bug where the `PopGenStatistics` class did not have the `verbose` and `debug` attributes.
- Fixed lots of bugs with VCFReader class when reading and writing VCF files.
- Fixed bugs in StructureReader and PhylipReader classes when reading and writing STRUCTURE and PHYLIP files.
- Fixed bug where the `PopGenStatistics` class did not have the `genotype_data` attribute.

### Enhancements

- VCFReader is now much faster, with benchmarks showing a 40 percent speedup when reading VCF files.
- Added optional `store_format_data` parameter to the `VCFReader` class to store FORMAT metadata in the HDF5 file. Set this to `True` to store FORMAT metadata in the HDF5 file. This can be useful if the format metadata is needed for downstream analysis, but it does drastically slow down the reading and writing of VCF files.
- Added support for reading and writing GenePop files with the `GenePopReader` class.
- `StructureReader` now supports `has_popids` and `has_marker_names` parameters to indicate whether the STRUCTURE file has population IDs column and marker names header row. This allows for more flexibility when reading STRUCTURE files.
- General improvements to code for performance and maintainability.

### Features

- Added new `GenePopReader` class to read and write GenePop files. This class can read GenePop files and convert them to any of the other supported formats. `write_genepop()` method can be used to write the data to a GenePop file from any of the supported formats (VCF, PHYLIP, STRUCTURE, GENEPOP).
- All file formats are interoperable and can be converted to and from each other. This means that you can read a VCF file, convert it to a PHYLIP file, and then convert it to a STRUCTURE file, and so on.

## Version 1.23 (2025-04-08)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with `summary_statistics()` where the Weir and Cockerham (1984) Fst calculation was not being performed correctly. The method now calculates pairwise Weir and Cockerham (1984) Fst between populations, saves a heatmap with the Fst values, and saves the pairwise table as a CSV file. The method also returns a pandas DataFrame with the Fst values.
- Fixed issues with `neis_genetic_distance()` where the Nei's genetic distance calculation was not being performed correctly. The method now calculates pairwise Nei's genetic distance between populations, saves a heatmap with the genetic distances, and saves the pairwise table as a CSV file. The method also returns a pandas DataFrame with the genetic distances.`
